Hi folks, I'm Mark Morowczynski, a principal security researcher in the Microsoft Global Hunting, Oversight, and Strategic Triage (GHOST) team.

Previously I was a principal product manager in the Microsoft Security Customer Experience Engineering (CxE) team working with customers on their deployments of Microsoft Entra ID/Azure AD.

I'll be using this site for a few things:

1. I'm building up several skills outside my normal work. Things such as collaborating via Git, GitHub, and Markdown are not something I do day to day. This site will help with that.
2. I'd like to spend more time developing deeper skills in security research, specifically on the Apple platforms and ARM.
3. I plan on blogging about what I've learned.
4. I want a central location for presentations and posts. You can see that in the 'created content' section.

You can and should read the official blog for [Microsoft Entra ID/Azure AD posts](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/bg-p/Identity).

Outside the technology space I enjoy reading and watching baseball, hockey and basketball.
