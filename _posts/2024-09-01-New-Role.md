After nine years on the Customer Experience Engineering (CxE) team, I decided to take on a new role at Microsoft. I'm moving to the Global Hunting, Oversight, and Strategic Triage (GHOST) team as a security researcher, and I couldn't be more excited to take on this new challenge. I'll be using many of the things I've learned in SANS courses, working with customers and the community. I still plan on focusing on identity and the Apple platforms, but I will now do so with a different and more specific focus. I'll try to continue to blog about what I'm learning and things I'm working on here as much as I can, though it might get quite a bit busy while I get comfortable in my new role.
