For most companies, they have an instance set up. As someone whose Apple “Enterprise” is their own lab of a few devices, I haven’t had any hands-on experience with ABM. This also includes something that is becoming increasingly important, Managed Apple IDs or, as it’s now known, Managed Apple Accounts as of WWDC 2024. These are needed if you are trying to use any features of the <a href="https://beta.apple.com/it">AppleSeed for IT program</a>.</p> <p>Kandji has a nice blog about the history of the managed Apple ID space: https://blog.kandji.io/managed-apple-id-evolution. At the start of 2024 I thought this would be a perfect time to set up my own instance of Apple Business Manager. Doing a search for prior steps on how to do this led me to the always excellent Rich Trotons <a href="https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2023/09/04/starting-a-sole-proprietorship-business-to-get-a-duns-number-for-apple-business-manager/">blog</a>.</p> <p>I thought I would share my experience and steps in early 2024 of setting this up. It is possible some of these steps have changed when you go through the process, as updates are happening all the time. Tom Bridge called this out around this time last year that the <a href="https://tombridge.com/2023/08/18/positive-changes-to-apple-business-manager-signup-flows/">sign-up experience has improved</a>.</p> <p>Before we get into the details, this is solely my experience setting this up in the United States. Please consult experts local to your region if you are actually going to be setting this up for your actual business. I am not that expert for you.</p> <p>The first thing I did was sign up for an EIN number and follow the sole proprietorship setup: https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online.</p> <p>The second thing was to purchase a domain name. This is not a requirement to set up ABM, but I was trying to make my own enterprise setup as realistic as possible.</p> <p>Then, I applied for a DUNS number at https://www.dnb.com/duns/get-a-duns.html. I selected the free version and uploaded the EIN PDF. Two days later, I received my DUNS number. The website says this can take up to 30 days.</p> <p>With this DUNS number in hand, I was ready to start with ABM following this <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ke/guide/apple-business-manager/axm402206497/web">documentation</a>.</p> <p>I clicked through Get Started to provide my information in the form.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/ABM_SetUp_1_Form.png" alt="Sign Up"/></p> <p><em>Apple Business Manager Sign Up</em></p> <p>It then asked me to create an account.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/ABM_SetUp_2_Create_Account.png" alt="Create Account"/></p> <p><em>Apple Business Manager Create Account</em></p> <p>I had to verify the account, set up a phone number for multi-factor, and agree with the terms and conditions. I was then welcomed with the ABM screen.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/ABM_SetUp_3_Welcome.png" alt="Welcome"/></p> <p><em>Welcome to Apple Business Manager !</em></p> <p>The next step the documentation mentions is to verify your organization. You can do some basic functionality without verifying and you only have 59 days to complete the verification process.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/ABM_SetUp_4_Unverified.png" alt="Unverified"/></p> <p><em>Organization is unveified to start</em></p> <p>This is where the DUNS number comes in. You add the DUNS number to your organazition in ABM. Apple will also call the verification contact to confirm information about your organization and ensure that it actually exists.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/ABM_SetUp_5_Pending.png" alt="Pending"/></p> <p><em>Organization is now pending</em></p> <p>Once that process is complete, you will see that your verification of ABM is complete.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/ABM_SetUp_6_Complete.png" alt="Complete"/></p> <p><em>Organization verification is now complete</em></p> <p>The last thing I did at this time was to verify the domain I had purchased by following this <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ke/guide/apple-business-manager/axm48c3280c0/web">documentation</a>. The TXT record hostname should be @ and the value will be something similar to “apple-domain-verification=YourUniqueValue”. You can now create Managed Apple IDs/Managed Apple Accounts with that domain name.</p> <p>I’d also like to add that Tom Bridge gave an excellent session in July 2024 at PSU MacAdmins on Managed Apple IDs and showed some of these latest sign-up experiences in his <a href="https://youtu.be/xA0D6oVzcUk?si=Kd26UaruSl8kqhmR">talk</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes"/><category term="learning"/><category term="apple"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[And You Can Too!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">SANS SEC540 Cloud Security and DevSecOps Automation</title><link href="https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/SANS-SEC-540/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SANS SEC540 Cloud Security and DevSecOps Automation"/><published>2024-06-15T05:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-15T05:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/SANS-SEC-540</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/SANS-SEC-540/"><![CDATA[<p>The fourth and final class I took in the SANS Cloud Security <a href="https://www.sans.edu/cyber-security-programs/graduate-certificate-cloud-security/">certificate program</a> was <a href="https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/cloud-security-devsecops-automation/">SEC 540 Cloud Security and DevSecOps Automation</a>. The course just underwent a significant update near the beginning of the year. This was going to be, by far, the most challenging class for me in the cloud program. Though technically, I have a Computer Science degree, I’ve spent most of my time on the administration side. I am aware of things like DevOps and CI/CD pipelines, but actually leveraging them in a day-to-day matter is not something I’ve done. My skills in using git were questionable at best.</p> <p>This class was extremely useful for any developers who should be moving to these modern DevOps practices, as well as administrators who are moving to more cloud-based architectures. It really helped me see how many of the benefits of the DevOps mindset could be applied. You decide if you want to do the labs in AWS or Azure. The first day of the course focuses on general DevOps practices and pipelines. The last part of day 1 is focused on secrets management. I felt this day really helped me get hands on with these concepts and I actually made a few mistakes in the labs so I really got to understand the setup by troubleshooting different parts.</p> <p>Day 2 was focused on configuration management and infrastructure as code (IaC). There is also a good section on containers and Docker that I thought was especially helpful for me in understanding how this is leveraged. Day 3, I think, was the hardest day for me; it was almost entirely focused on Kubernetes. Again, I’m aware of this at a high level, but this day forces you to get into the weeds of it. It took me a bit, but now I have a solid understanding of it. Day 4 was microservices and serverless architectures. I was a bit more familiar with these from the previous classes. The final day 5 was how to bake compliance checks into all of this and some additional security protections you can do, like WAFs. This wasn’t too bad.</p> <p>Overall, the labs were great, and you really see the power of DevOps. My git is a bit better as well. The exam was very similar to the practice exams. I passed this a few weeks ago, and my program has come to an end. I did 4 SANS cloud classes in about 11 months. I would really recommend this program, but I’m very much looking forward to a break from the strict study schedule.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes"/><category term="learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[GIAC GCSA Exam]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">SANS SEC541 Cloud Security Attacker Techniques, Monitoring, and Threat Detection</title><link href="https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/SANS-SEC-541/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SANS SEC541 Cloud Security Attacker Techniques, Monitoring, and Threat Detection"/><published>2024-06-01T05:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-01T05:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/SANS-SEC-541</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/SANS-SEC-541/"><![CDATA[<p>The third class I took in the SANS Cloud Security <a href="https://www.sans.edu/cyber-security-programs/graduate-certificate-cloud-security/">certificate program</a> was <a href="https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/cloud-security-attacker-techniques-monitoring-threat-detection/">SEC 541 Cloud Security Attacker Techniques, Monitoring, and Threat Detection</a>. This really is <strong>THE</strong> blue team course for cloud infrastructure. Shaun McCullough and Ryan Nicholson did a great job with it. It’s a good balance between AWS and Azure. The course uses real-world examples of attacks tied to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK TTPs, then goes through how to ensure proper logging is enabled and detect the various attacks. The last day of the course I took focused on ways to push automation into all these different detections.</p> <p>The labs for this course are HEAVY on the commands. It is very easy to just copy and paste from the lab book to complete the task quickly. Do not do that. Copy from the workbook so you don’t make typos, but really make sure you understand what the commands are doing. This is needed not only for the exam, but you can easily take these back to your day-to-day work, and if you understand the components, quickly update them for your environment.</p> <p>For the GCTD exam, it was very similar to the practice tests. If you really understand the material it’s not too difficult.</p> <p>This was technically one of the program’s electives, but I recommend that everyone take it. It is the best cloud defense focus class I’ve taken.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes"/><category term="learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[GIAC GCTD Exam]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Definitive Guide to KQL Now Available</title><link href="https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/KQL-Is-Available/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Definitive Guide to KQL Now Available"/><published>2024-05-26T16:19:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-26T16:19:00+00:00</updated><id>https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/KQL-Is-Available</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/KQL-Is-Available/"><![CDATA[<p>The wait is over!

I’m no stranger to SANS courses, completing their master’s program from 2018 through 2022. Luckily, my employer has a tuition reimbursement program allows me to take these courses over multiple years to maximize the benefit. It was a lot of work, but I learned a lot in each SANS course. The community I’ve met throughout my time has also been fantastic. If you can afford it, I highly recommend SANS.</p> <p>Before enrolling in this course, explain why I signed up for four other courses. Living in the Microsoft identity world, I am familiar with Azure. I’ve taken several Azure exams and have a general idea of the correct direction. When it comes to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), I have never even touched it. I’m aware of some of the very basics, such as storage in AWS being called S3, GCP having virtual machines, etc. But I needed to familiarize myself with how you set this up and what the best practices are.</p> <p>I was also starting to spend more time at work with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-permissions-management">Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (MEPM)</a>, a cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) product. This is integrated with AWS and GCP, as well as Azure. Going deeper on AWS and GCP would be a big help on many of the findings and remediation actions MEPM recommends, which requires some knowledge of these additional cloud providers. Finally, most customers I work with are in at least two of these clouds. There are further courses that I also had weak spots in that I needed to improve on, so I signed up for the program.</p> <p>The first course in their program is <a href="https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/cloud-security-essentials/">Security 488: Cloud Security Essentials</a>. You can read the site for all the full details of what’s covered, but at a high level, you create your own AWS account and Azure subscription, along with the IAM accounts to go with it. You then spin up a small Linux VM in Azure and set up your lab environment for the week via Terraform. You don’t have to write terraform code, but it spins up this really nice lab environment. The labs showcase the different topics covered and give some nice things to go back to and ensure you are doing in your own environment.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/CDCALab.png" alt="Lab"/> <em>The SEC 488 lab diagram that you use throughout the five day course.</em></p> <p>Then, throughout the five days, you’ll cover the fundamentals of each cloud provider as you build out the environment for a fictional rock band CD/CA. When teaching a topic, take networking, for example; it will start with the basics and use AWS as the first example. Then, it will move to Azure and call out where it’s different. Finally, the topic will move to GCP. This style tends to make the course content skew a bit heavier to AWS, then Azure, and finally, GCP is the smallest. This is aligned with what I see at most customers where AWS and Azure are the vast majority, and there is possibly some GCP for specific workloads. If you are a very large GCP shop, consider looking at something more specific to that elsewhere.</p> <p>For me, this course was a really great introduction to the other additional cloud providers. This is a 400-level fundamental course, so there wasn’t anything too tricky topic-wise. Many of the topics were covered in other security courses, but this had the cloud flavor of it. I’d recommend this course if you are getting started in this cloud space or are really heavy on one cloud provider and beginning to branch out. This would also be great as a second course if you have just taken SEC 401 Security Essentials and then wanted to get started with the cloud. If you’ve been maintaining two or three of these cloud providers for several years, have made a few mistakes along the way, and learned from them, you probably won’t find as much value as I did.</p> <p>The GIAC <a href="https://www.giac.org/certifications/cloud-security-essentials-gcld/">Cloud Security Essentials (GCLD)</a> exam is pretty straightforward, like most GIAC exams. I will give you a tip in making your index that I did. Put the topic area first and then add the cloud provider next if you need to. This prevents you from remembering whether you called something Amazon AWS or AWS or a feature like CloudTrail. This will help you locate the area quicker when taking the exam.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes"/><category term="learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[GIAC GCLD Exam]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">SANS SEC510 Public Cloud Security AWS, Azure and GCP</title><link href="https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/SANS-SEC-510/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SANS SEC510 Public Cloud Security AWS, Azure and GCP"/><published>2024-02-18T16:19:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-18T16:19:00+00:00</updated><id>https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/SANS-SEC-510</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/SANS-SEC-510/"><![CDATA[<p>As discussed in my previous <a href="/_posts/2024-02-18-SANS-SEC-488.md">post</a>, I took SEC 510 shortly after taking 488. This class is an excellent extension to that. You can read all the class specifics at the <a href="https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/public-cloud-security-aws-azure-gcp/">site</a>. Where 488 covered these cloud concepts and set up an environment using Terraform, 510 actually goes deeper, where you discuss what it takes to set up a cloud environment and create and modify similar Terraform scripts. If you are tasked with setting up your organization’s cloud infrastructure and being able to do so by focusing on automation and security across all three cloud providers, 510 is a great class.</p> <p>In 510 there is a similar fake company you are working at the pre-work setup requires you to create an AWS account, Azure subscription and a GCP project. You can pick which cloud you want to use for most of the labs or do the same lab in all three clouds. This is really great and showcases what it takes to run an application or service in multiple clouds. I started doing each lab in all three but eventually ended up just rotating through to get good exposure in all of them.</p> <p>As for the GIAC GPCS exam, it was similar to the practice tests and again straightforward. Something that helped me a lot was making sure I could easily pull up any of the slides with the Terraform configuration. I scored very well on this exam and felt I could have dug deeper into the Terraform aspects. If I were in a cloud engineering-type role rolling out cloud infrastructure, I would refer back to this and do some of the optional labs.</p> <p>Overall, this was a really great course!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes"/><category term="learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[GIAC GPCS Exam]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Mac Hacker’s Handbook</title><link href="https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/2024-The-Mac-Hackers-Handbook/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Mac Hacker’s Handbook"/><published>2024-01-27T16:19:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-27T16:19:00+00:00</updated><id>https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/2024-The-Mac-Hackers-Handbook</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/2024-The-Mac-Hackers-Handbook/"><![CDATA[<p>In 2011, Wiley released <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Mac+Hacker%27s+Handbook-p-9781118080337">The Mac Hacker’s Handbook</a> by Charlie Millerwon and Dino Dai Zovi. The book focuses on the basics of Mac OS X (note this is before it was called OS X and now just macOS), the attack surface of the operating system, looking for bugs and vulnerabilities, as well as many of the tools and techniques you would use to exploit it. This is similar in style to the many other The ‘insert name’ hacker’s handbook, with ‘Web Application’ being the one I see recommended the most. This book leverages Mac OS X 10.5, also known as Leopard, as the host operating system to walk through teaching you these different attacks and tools.</p> <p>You might wonder, Mac OS X 10.5, do those attacks still work? They do not. We are talking about an operating system that was released in 2007. The first Apple computer I bought was an iBook G4 that came with Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, and I remember upgrading it to Leopard and eventually Snow Leopard. Yes, it is old. So why do this? First, you’d be surprised at how many of the tools you’ll still use today that are covered in this book. Second, these techniques are fundamental and much easier to do on this older operating system. This is a great way to learn and apply it to much more modern and better-protected operating systems. You have to crawl before you can run.</p> <p>This brings us to the next challenge: how do you run Mac OS X 10.5 in 2024. I do not have my iBook G4 anymore. My first step was to try to run this as a virtual machine on VMWare Fusion. I ran into two challenges. First, in order to install, you need to take the DMG file and convert it to an ISO. The good news is that the built-in Disk Utility tool can convert a DMG to an ISO. The second issue was that VMWare Fusion would only run MacOS X Server licenses as per its license agreement. I did not have a copy of Mac OS X Leopard Server, and I suspect many of the examples in the book would work, but I wasn’t sure.</p> <p>I then tried installing Mac OS X 10.5 in Virtual Box, and I got a bit further along as it actually started. I was met with a kernel panic: “com.apple.driver.AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement”. Doing a bit of searching led me to a similar post <a href="https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=109476">here</a>. The fix is to set the virtual CPU with this command, /Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/VBoxManage modifyvm Leopard –cpu-profile ‘Intel Core2 T7600 2.33GHz’. Leopard is the name of my VM.</p> <p>After that, it booted and installed as expected! I now have my test environment set up and ready to go!</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/Leopard_Running_VirtualBox.png" alt="Leopard"/> <em>Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard running in a VM in Virtual Box on Macbook Pro host</em></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="research"/><category term="learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Isn't that book really old?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">2024 Update</title><link href="https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/2024_Update/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2024 Update"/><published>2024-01-07T16:19:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-07T16:19:00+00:00</updated><id>https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/2024_Update</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://markmorow.com/blog/2024/2024_Update/"><![CDATA[<p>Sorry, it has been so long. Let’s start with the good news first. The KQL book is nearly done. I say nearly because it’s not done done. It’s still going through the copy editor phases, and I’ll need to do a final review and edits. This is minor, though, compared to the core writing. We contacted numerous Microsoft folks to get some of their favorite and recommended KQL queries. The book is already up on Amazon for <a href="https://a.co/d/cHevMAX">purchase</a>.</p> <p>The bad news is that this took much of the free time I had planned to write things here. I also finished an additional SANS cloud security class, <a href="https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/public-cloud-security-aws-azure-gcp/">SEC 510 Public Cloud Security: AWS, Azure, and GCP</a>, and I’m nearly done with <a href="https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/cloud-security-attacker-techniques-monitoring-threat-detection/">SEC 541 Cloud Security Attacker Techniques, Monitoring, and Threat Detection</a>. I’ll write up some little reviews of those as well.</p> <p>I have also taken on another <a href="https://sabr.org/">SABR</a> project around the 2005 White Sox, but that’s a story for another post.

June was a hectic month, and when I finally looked up, it was over. So where did my time go if I wasn’t spent focusing on security research?</p> <p>As the homepage says, I enjoy watching baseball, hockey, and basketball outside of technology. That’s a bit simplistic, and besides playing fantasy baseball, I’m also a member of the Society For American Baseball Research, better known as <a href="https://sabr.org/">SABR</a>. You might have heard this when you watched that Moneyball movie, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MjxoaynCmk">“Because he gets on base.”</a> SABR was around long before that and continues long after. Though there is a significant focus on baseball stats, one of the things they do is preserve the history of the game. There are many aspects of that, but where I spent my time was on their <a href="https://sabr.org/bioproject">biography project</a>.</p> <p>Late last year, my friend and fellow SABR member, <a href="https://www.ericconrad.com/">Eric Conrad</a>, decided we would try to write something for this project. Shortly after that, a call for volunteers went out for members to write biographies for an upcoming 2004 Boston Red Sox book. Eric is a Red Sox fan, so we raised our digital hands despite having no idea what we were doing. We were assigned Sandy and Anastacio Martinez, who is most likely NOT the Martinez you think of when you think of this Boston team. This whole writing process is a much longer story: asking people in Toronto to go to the local library, Eric buying a lot of old Sporting News off eBay, and me making an international cold call to Sandy on a Monday morning. We are really pleased with how these turned out, and we have some more SABR stuff coming that I’ll share in the future, but this took much more time than I thought it would.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/Moneyball.jpg" alt="Moneyball"/></p> <p>I also enrolled in the <a href="https://www.sans.edu/cyber-security-programs/graduate-certificate-cloud-security/">SANS Cloud Security Graduate Certificate Program</a>. Much of my day-to-day work focuses on Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management or CIEM. I have a decent knowledge of Azure but very little of AWS and GCP. I just wrapped up the first class in the program, <a href="https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/cloud-security-essentials/">Cloud Security Essentials</a>. Much time has also been spent outside of work preparing for this entire space.</p> <p>This leads me to the final bit, Kusto Query Language, aka <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/">KQL</a>. For the last year, I’ve been bothering <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewzorich/">Matthew Zorich</a> to write this book on KQL. My skills on KQL fall into the ‘could be better’ bucket, so I was excited to read this. A series of events have occurred, and now Matthew, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodtrent/">Rod Trent</a>, and myself are signed up to write ‘The Definitive Guide to KQL: Using Kusto Query Language for Operations, Defending, and Threat Hunting.’ This will be out sometime in 2024. I’ll focus on the language’s fundamental aspects, but this will be an excellent forcing function for me to REALLY understand this language. Look for more updates on this later.</p> <p>Until next time.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="notes"/><category term="learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What do baseball, security and Kusto have in common?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Contributing to LOOBins</title><link href="https://markmorow.com/blog/2023/LOOBins/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Contributing to LOOBins"/><published>2023-05-29T16:19:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-29T16:19:00+00:00</updated><id>https://markmorow.com/blog/2023/LOOBins</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://markmorow.com/blog/2023/LOOBins/"><![CDATA[<p>I came across this open-source project called <a href="https://www.loobins.io/">LOOBins</a> which I thought would be the perfect place to get started in doing some macOS research and provide something of value to the security community.</p> <p>LOOBins stands for Living Off the Orchard, get it, cause of ‘Apple.’ Like many security tools, we got to have some jokes in there. It’s looking for built-in macOS binaries and how threat actors can use them for malicious purposes. This concept of ‘Living Off The Land’ isn’t new, but seeing something like this for macOS is excellent.</p> <p>Luckily, I could pick a binary, hdiutil, and contribute to the project <a href="https://www.loobins.io/binaries/hdiutil/">here</a>. This required me to research how this worked, look to see if it had been used before in a malicious way, which it actually had, and then see where this fit in the MITRE Att&amp;ck. This took me a bit longer than I thought it would, and there are probably more scenarios I need to add, but I’m pleased it was accepted.</p> <p>If you are interested in contributing, several other binaries are looking for someone to look at. The complete issues list can be found <a href="https://github.com/infosecB/LOOBins/issues">here</a>. I’m wrapping up a few other non-tech-related writing projects shortly, but this is a project I hope to be able to continue to contribute to in the future.</p> <p>I also realize it’s been about a month since my last post. So I’ll try to post a bit more frequently going forward but at least post once a month.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="research"/><category term="learning"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Living Off the Orchard, macOS Binaries]]></summary></entry></feed>
